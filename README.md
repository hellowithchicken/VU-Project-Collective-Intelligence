# VU Project Collective Intelligence

An assignments I have designed for the Project Collective Intelligence course at the VU Amsterdam, part of BSc Artificial Intelligence (under the supervision of dr. Eliseo Ferrante and dr. Nicolas Cambier).

The main task of the assignment is to develop a basic agent-based predator-prey model, expand it and carry out your own research. 

## Lecture and assignment:

- A lecture I delivered to provide students with a theoretical Lotka-Volterra preditor-prey ODE modelling background can be found [here](https://github.com/hellowithchicken/VU-Project-Collective-Intelligence/blob/main/slides-introduction-assignment-2.pdf).

- The assignment guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/hellowithchicken/VU-Project-Collective-Intelligence/blob/main/guidelines-assignment-2.pdf).
